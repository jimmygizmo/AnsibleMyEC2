# AnsibleMyEC2
Automate your EC2 instances with clean/cimple Ansible: Create, Setup, Deploy, Operate: Full Stack Apps

Ansible running locally in a Python virtual environment, set up in the simplest and cleanest possible way to empower developers who use AWS EC2 instances for straightforward, containerized full stack deployments.

I develop The Nucleus Stack, full stack starter kit and complete application stack with modular component/enhancement stacks.

This is the Ansible set up I use to work with a handful of t2.micro to t2.medium instances to run different projects and different configurations of Nucleus and variants .. or anything at all I need to run.

Docker and Docker Compose are installed on Amazon Linux. The Linux environment is very nicely configured. Your VM is ready for development or single instance production hosting.

I'll keep this project simple. I have another project for a containerized Ansible stack which can be used in the same small team development context, or for enterprise DevOps deployment.

Enjoy!
