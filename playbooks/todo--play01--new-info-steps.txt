TODO: Possibly re-order some of the info commands and group better.

TODO: Make a shorter info playbook for more frequent monitoring. Then make one that packages a data summary for
  even more frequent and formal monitoring, possibly for special use cases like performance/load testing.

CLARIFY: Why did I not see this in the above command?

[ec2-user ~]$ service snmpd status
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl status snmpd.service
● snmpd.service - Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Daemon.
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/snmpd.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)

OK .. it seems these systemctl redirects don't happen for --status-all

[ec2-user ~]$ systemctl status snmpd
● snmpd.service - Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Daemon.
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/snmpd.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)
[ec2-user ~]$

TODO: ADD NEW INFO STEPS FOR BOTH OF THE ABOVE .. (make the second one the equivalent for ALL services .. systemctl)
